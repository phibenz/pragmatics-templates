      I'm making pancakes for breakfast.
      I added a cup of flour, a teaspoon of salt, and a few tablespoons of sugar to a bowl.
      I stirred it together, then added a cup of milk, a beaten egg, and a few tablespoons of oil, and stirred until just mixed.
      Then I put 1/4 a cup on a hot frying pan, and flipped it when brown. But they're terrible! Why? List the main reason.

      Consider this program

      ```python
      import numpy as np

      array = np.zeros((10, 20, 30))
      idxs = [1, 2, 3]

      print("The first array shape is", array[0][:, idxs].shape)
      print("The second array shape is", array[0, :, idxs].shape)
      ```

      Tell me what this program will print, and then explain why the two print statements don't print the same thing.

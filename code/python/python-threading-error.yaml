          I showed a student some code with a bug. 
          I then tested their understanding by asking them to explain hwo to fix the bug. 
          I'm going to show you their answer, I want you to evaluate whether or not their answer says something to the effect of "The function create_speech_file is raising an exception that can not be pickled.". 
          Do not judge their reasonining, or if they know how to fix it, just tell me if they correctly identified that there is a crash in the create_speech_file function. 
          Student Answer: 
          {{ANSWER}}

          Think out loud then answer either "The student passes" or "The student fails".

    evaluators:
      - type: word
        words:
          - "student passes"

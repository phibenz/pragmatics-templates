      I want to vectorize a function

      ```python
      frame = np.zeros((out_h, out_w, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
      for i, val1 in enumerate(rows):
          for j, val2 in enumerate(cols):
              for j, val3 in enumerate(ch):
                  # Assuming you want to store the pair as tuples in the matrix
                  frame[i, j, k] = image[val1, val2, val3]

      out.write(np.array(frame))
      ```

      Name a simple numpy function that does something like this. What is it called?

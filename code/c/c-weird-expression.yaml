          Below is a student's answer to a question about what a particular C expression evaluates to:
          {{ANSWER}}
          
          Does the student's final answer say that the expression evaluates to *x+2?
          Ignore their reasoning. Just look at the final answer, if they say **EXPLICITLY** that the answer is *x+2. 
          Giving something that's equal but more complicated is wrong. 

          If the answer is correct say "The student passes" otherwise "The student fails".
